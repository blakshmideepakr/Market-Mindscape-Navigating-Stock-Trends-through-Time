### Introduction

<p align="justify">Stock market prediction has always been a challenging problem in the field of finance. This project aims to address this problem by implementing a predictive model using time series data. Here's an overview of the project:

- Data collection: Real-time stock data is fetched using the Alpha Vantage API.
- Data preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and feature engineering is performed.
- <p align="justify">Model building: A combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models is used to predict stock prices.
- Testing the model: The model's performance is evaluated, and predictions are visualized.

### Data Preprocessing and Analysis

- Data collection: Real-time stock data is fetched from Alpha Vantage API.
- Data preprocessing: Missing values are filled, and various indicators like moving averages are computed.
- Visualization: The data is visualized to understand trends and patterns in stock prices.

### Model Building

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): CNN layers are used for feature extraction.
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): LSTM layers are used for sequence modeling.
- Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Testing the Model

- The model is tested with historical stock data to make predictions.
- Metrics such as R-squared and explained variance are used to evaluate the model's performance.
- Predicted and actual stock prices are visualized for comparison.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset.
- Box plots, histograms, and correlation matrices are used for data visualization.
- The correlation between features is analyzed to understand relationships.
